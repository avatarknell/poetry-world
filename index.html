        <h2 class="poemTitle">Woes of the Dead</h2>
        All we ever wanted was peace,<br>
        But alive, we couldn't get it,<br>
        Our deaths weren't merciful either,<br>
        We hung from ropes of leather,<br>
        Waiting for beautiful death to grab us<br><br>
        Death wasn't the salvation we expected,<br>
        What a cruel mistress she was,<br>
        Our souls were strung over flames,<br>
        We wailed but who could save us?<br>
        The rest of the fuel?<br><br>
        We did the unthinkable,<br>
        Hell we left it behind,<br>
        refugees from death itself,<br>
        yet we couldn't seek shelter among the living,<br>
        Our bodies had been food to the beasts of wild,<br>
        No graves for scum as lowly as us,<br><br>
        We are the homeless,<br>
        Dead But not in the underworld,<br>
        We roam the wters and the wild,<br>
        Hoping to get even morsels of our bones,<br>
        So we may finally have a bit of home,<br>
        In the coldness of our remains.<br>
